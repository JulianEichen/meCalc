Task (extract):

- Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators[...]. add, subtract, multiply & divide
- Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key. 
- Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. **For example, $12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =$ should yield $42$.**
- Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
